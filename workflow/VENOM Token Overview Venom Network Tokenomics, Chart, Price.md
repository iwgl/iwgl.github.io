# VENOM Token Overview | Venom Network | Tokenomics, Chart, Price  

Venom Network's native cryptocurrency, **VENOM**, serves as both the utility and governance token for this high-performance blockchain ecosystem. Comparable to Ethereum's ETH or BNB Chain's BNB, VENOM powers transaction fees, network security, decentralized governance, and DeFi operations. This comprehensive guide explores VENOM's tokenomics, technical architecture, and practical applications while providing actionable insights for investors and developers.  

## Key VENOM Token Metrics  

- **Token Name:** VENOM (Venom Network)

## Practical Applications of VENOM  

### 1. **Gas Fee Payments**  
All transaction costs within the Venom Networkâ€”including smart contract interactions, NFT minting, and token transfersâ€”are paid exclusively in VENOM. This creates consistent demand for the token as network activity grows.  

### 2. **Network Security via Proof-of-Stake**  
Validators must stake VENOM to participate in consensus, ensuring network integrity. Higher staked amounts increase resistance to Sybil attacks, where malicious actors attempt to control the network through fake identities.  

### 3. **Delegated Staking (DePools)**  
Token holders unable to run validator nodes can delegate their VENOM to DePools. This process democratizes participation and rewards users proportionally to their staked amounts.  

### 4. **Decentralized Governance**  
VENOM holders vote on protocol upgrades, treasury allocations, and ecosystem development proposals. Governance weight scales with token holdings, fostering community-driven decision-making.  

### 5. **Ecosystem Development**  
As the backbone of Venom Network, VENOM fuels liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), powers NFT marketplaces, and supports Web3 applications.

## Wrapped VENOM (WVENOM): Bridging DeFi Compatibility  

While VENOM is the native token, **WVENOM** operates as a TIP-3 standard token within smart contracts. This wrapped version enables seamless integration with DeFi protocols, facilitating:  

- **Liquidity Provision:** Users stake WVENOM in liquidity pools to earn trading fees.  
- **Yield Farming:** Composable DeFi strategies leverage WVENOM for yield optimization.  
- **Dex Trading:** Pairs like WVENOM/USDT enable price discovery and asset swaps.  

**Example Workflow:**  
`VENOM â†’ WVENOM â†’ DEX Trade â†’ WVENOM â†’ VENOM`  
This conversion occurs automatically through smart contracts, ensuring user-friendly experiences.

## Technical Architecture of Venom Network  

Venom Network leverages a **multi-threaded virtual machine (TVM)** based on the actor model. Key innovations include:  

- **Parallel Processing:** Isolates smart contract executions (actors) to enable simultaneous transactions.  
- **Dynamic Sharding:** Automatically adjusts network segmentation to maintain high throughput (10,000+ TPS).  
- **Asynchronous Execution:** Reduces latency by processing non-dependent operations concurrently.  

This architecture positions Venom Network as a scalable solution for enterprise-grade dApps requiring Ethereum-level security with significantly lower fees.

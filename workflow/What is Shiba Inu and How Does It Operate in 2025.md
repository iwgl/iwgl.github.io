## Understanding the Shiba Inu Ecosystem: SHIB, LEASH, and BONE

The Shiba Inu ecosystem operates through three core tokens, each serving distinct yet complementary roles:

### 1. **SHIB: The Utility Token**
As the primary token, SHIB facilitates transactions, staking, and governance within the ecosystem. By 2025, SHIB has been adopted by major retailers and integrated into popular crypto wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask, enhancing its usability.

### 2. **LEASH: The Store of Value**
Originally designed as a volatile reset token, LEASH has evolved into a deflationary asset with limited supply. Its price is algorithmically adjusted based on SHIB‚Äôs market performance, making it an attractive option for long-term holders.

### 3. **BONE: Governance and DeFi**
BONE powers ShibaSwap, the ecosystem‚Äôs decentralized exchange (DEX). Holders use BONE to vote on protocol upgrades, liquidity incentives, and new feature integrations. By 2025, ShibaSwap has expanded to include yield farming, NFT trading, and cross-chain compatibility.

## ShibaSwap: The Heart of the Ecosystem

ShibaSwap remains central to SHIB‚Äôs utility, offering users:

- **Staking**: Earn rewards by locking SHIB, LEASH, or BONE.
- **Yield Farming**: Provide liquidity to earn passive income.
- **NFT Marketplace**: Buy, sell, and trade Shiba-themed NFTs.
- **DeFi Products**: Access lending protocols and decentralized derivatives.

This integrated approach has created a self-sustaining economy, driving demand for all three tokens while reducing reliance on external platforms.

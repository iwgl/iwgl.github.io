## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is this cryptocurrency priced at $0?

The $0 valuation typically indicates either technical price discovery issues on tracking platforms or extremely low market capitalization. This often occurs with newly launched tokens or assets experiencing rapid price declines.

### What does "marked for deletion" mean?

CoinStats maintains quality standards by removing assets that fail to meet minimum activity requirements. This usually involves insufficient trading volume, lack of exchange listings, or incomplete data reporting.

### Should I invest in cryptocurrencies with low market activity?

Investing in low-activity cryptocurrencies carries significant risks including:  
- Limited liquidity  
- Potential for price manipulation  
- Challenges in accurate price discovery  
- Regulatory uncertainties  

Professional investors typically allocate only small portions of portfolios to such speculative assets after thorough due diligence.

### How can I verify blockchain contract details?

Blockchain explorers like Etherscan (for Ethereum-based tokens) or BscScan (for Binance Smart Chain tokens) allow verification of contract addresses, tokenomics, and transaction history. This verification becomes essential for assets with unconventional market data.

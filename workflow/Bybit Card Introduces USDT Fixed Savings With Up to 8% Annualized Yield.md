## Product Overview: Dual-Tier Yield Structure  

Bybit's tailored financial instrument features a dual-tier system designed to accommodate diverse investor profiles:  

| Tier Classification | Deposit Range (USDT) | Annualized Yield |  
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|  
| VIP Exclusive       | 200-5,000            | 4%               |

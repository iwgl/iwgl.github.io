## Step 1: Create an OKX Account  

To begin, you need an **OKX account**. Follow these steps:  
1. Visit the official OKX website.  
2. Click **"Register"** and choose your preferred method (email, phone, or Google).  
3. Complete identity verification (KYC) to unlock higher withdrawal limits and enhanced security.  

**Security Tip**: Use a strong password and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added protection.  

## Step 2: Locate Your OKX USDT Deposit Address  

Once your account is active:  
1. Navigate to **"Wallet" > "Deposit"**.  
2. Search for **USDT** and select the appropriate network (TRC20 or ERC20).  
   - **TRC20 (Tron)**: Faster and cheaper transactions.  
   - **ERC20 (Ethereum)**: Higher fees but greater network security.  
3. Copy your **USDT deposit address** or scan the QR code for convenience.  

**Important**: Always verify the network compatibility. Sending USDT via the wrong network may result in permanent loss.  

## Step 3: Initiate the Transfer from Your Wallet  

Now, prepare to send USDT from your external wallet or exchange:  
1. Open your source wallet (e.g., Trust Wallet, MetaMask) or exchange.  
2. Go to the **"Withdraw"** section for USDT.  
3. Paste the OKX deposit address and select the same network used in Step 2.  
4. Enter the amount and review transaction fees.  

**Example**: Sending 1,000 USDT via TRC20 might incur a $0.01 fee, whereas ERC20 could cost $5â€“$10 depending on Ethereum network congestion.  

## Step 4: Confirm the Transaction on the Blockchain  

After submitting the withdrawal:  
- **Blockchain Confirmations**: The network requires 1â€“2 confirmations for TRC20 and 15â€“30 for ERC20.  
- **Transaction ID (TXID)**: Track your transfer using the provided hash link.  

**FAQ**: Why isnâ€™t my USDT appearing?  
- Wait for confirmations. If the balance remains unchanged after 24 hours, contact [OKX Support](https://bit.ly/okx-bonus).  

## Step 5: Verify USDT Arrival on OKX  

Once confirmed:  
1. Log into your OKX account.  
2. Check the **"Transaction History"** under your wallet.  
3. The funds will be available for trading or withdrawal.

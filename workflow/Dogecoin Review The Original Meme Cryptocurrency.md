## The Origin Story of Dogecoin

What began as a humorous critique of cryptocurrency speculation in 2013 has become one of the most recognizable names in the industry. Australian developer Jackson Palmer jokingly proposed "Dogecoin" in a tweet, merging the viral Doge meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog with cryptocurrency terminology. The concept quickly gained traction, with IBM software engineer Billy Markus collaborating to transform the idea into a functional blockchain.

Key milestones include:  
- **December 2013**: Official launch of the Dogecoin blockchain  
- **2014**: Community-funded initiatives like the Jamaican bobsled team sponsorship  
- **2018**: Introduction of the DRC-20 token standard  

> **Did You Know?** The Dogecoin community has collectively funded multiple charitable projects, including clean water initiatives in Kenya through the Doge4Water campaign.

### Community Governance Emerges

Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin's development has been almost entirely community-driven. Early incidents like the 2013 wallet hack demonstrated the community's resilience, as users voluntarily contributed funds to compensate victims. This collective ethos became a defining characteristic, setting Dogecoin apart from more corporate-backed projects.

## How Does Dogecoin Work?

Built as a fork of Luckycoin (itself a Litecoin derivative), Dogecoin leverages **Scrypt-based mining** and **Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW)** consensus. This technical foundation enables merged mining with Litecoin, creating a symbiotic relationship between the two networks.

### Technical Specifications
| Feature              | Dogecoin Details                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Block Time           | 1 minute                         |
| Transaction Speed    | ~30 TPS                          |
| Mining Algorithm     | Scrypt                           |
| Supply Cap           | Uncapped                         |
| Transaction Fee      | ~$0.01 USD                       |

**AuxPoW Mechanism** allows miners to simultaneously secure both Litecoin and Dogecoin blockchains, enhancing network security while maintaining low energy costs.

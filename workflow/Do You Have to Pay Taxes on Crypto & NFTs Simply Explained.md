## The IRSâ€™ Stance on Filing Crypto Tax Returns  

The **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** classifies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) as "property" for tax purposes. This means **crypto assets are subject to the same tax rules as stocks or gold**. Key deadlines for filing tax returns depend on your tax year:  

- **Calendar year filers** (December 31 year-end) must submit individual income tax returns by **April 15**.  
- **Fiscal year filers** (ending on any month other than December) should file by the **15th day of the fourth month** after their fiscal year closes.

| > 1 year | Lower long-term capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on income) |
